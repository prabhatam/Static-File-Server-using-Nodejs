# Static-File-Server-using-Nodejs
This Node.js project is a simple static file server that serves HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. Using http, fs, and path, it handles HTTP requests, resolves file paths, and reads files from the system. With MIME type support and error handling, itâ€™s ideal for hosting static sites locally on a chosen port.
